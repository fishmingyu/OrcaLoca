# Running Agentless editor as integration of Orcar
Our Orcar system has high modularity, which allows it to integrate part of other system.
For instance, to run Orcar Localization + Agentless Edition, we just need to:
1. Run orcar localization evaluation script (TBD)
2. Run evaluate_orcar_agentless.py (TBD as the script above plans to change output format)
3. Move to thirdparty/Agentless and go through instructions in README_orcar.md
